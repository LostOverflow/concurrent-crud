# Football Scoreboard

## sportradar demo project

### Is a simple java library to keep tracking current football matches

# Notes:

Tech requirements a little inconsistent:

1. nothing was mentioned about 'thread safety' in PDF test file but was
mentioned at the notification email. If to keep following all recommendations very strictly you could become to a
question: should I implement it in a thread safety style? If yes, then I probably could break KISS rule.
2. Get summary API method is actually not described about returning result. Not clear of should we just print result or
   return an object

During development keep always spell checker on, and check correct names. Apply into dictionary if it needs.

That actually is not finished for 100% but anyway I suppose it has some value to see.
