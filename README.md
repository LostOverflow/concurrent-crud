# Simple Bet 

## sportradar demo project

### Is a simple java library to keep tracking current football matches

# Notes:

Tech requirements a little inconsistent: nothing was mentioned about 'thread safety' in PDF test file but was
mentioned at the notification email. If to keep following all recommendations very strictly you could become to a
question: should I implement it in a thread safety style? If yes, then I probably could break KISS rule.

During development keep always spell checker on, and check correct names. Apply into dictionary if it needs.
